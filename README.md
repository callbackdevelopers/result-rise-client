New Technology: We will use Nextjs in our project. 
Reason: Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. One reason to use Next.js for generating results on a website is that it allows you to build a performant, SEO-friendly website that can prerender pages on the server, which can be especially useful for generating results that need to be displayed to the user quickly. Additionally, Next.js makes it easy to set up automatic code splitting, which can help reduce the time it takes for your website to load, and it also provides built-in support for server-side rendering, which can be useful for generating results that need to be displayed to search engines. Overall, Next.js is a useful tool for building modern, scalable websites that need to generate and display results in a fast and efficient manner.

Usage: Track student progress and annual result evolution.
